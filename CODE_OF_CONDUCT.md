# Code of Conduct

This project follows the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (v2.1), which is the template GitHub recommends for open source projects.

## Our Pledge
We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and graciously accepting constructive feedback.
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue at:
